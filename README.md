# PWA-Web-ARTT

## Summary
Augmented.Reality.Table.Top project as a PWA using ar.js library

The objective is to display 3D models of characters and enemies in AR using a phone or a webcam thus providing a experience similar to VTT but with the spiciness of IRL rpg session at a cheap cost. 

No need to buy expensive minifig, you just need a 3D model and to create a marker for it using [this web site](https://jeromeetienne.github.io/AR.js/three.js/examples/marker-training/examples/generator.html)

To use the application you need a device with a camera (phone, webcam) go to the AR page and scan the marker associated with the 3D model. As of now 2 models are available for testing purposes as it is not yet possible to upload your own 3D model. 
Both pattern png file are located in the src/pattern_images folder. You can either print or display the png files. If you are using a screen to diplay the pattern please be cautious of light reflection on your screen as it will disturb the library and your pattern may not be recognise. 

The upload page do not work  but a 3D model preview is here to show your 3D model you wish to upload (for now one of the test model is displayed for show)

To be implemented :
  - Allow user to upload custom models
  - Allow user to choose in the library what model they want to load
  - Better graphics for the app
