# PWA-Web-ARTT

## Summary
Augmented.Reality.Table.Top project as a PWA using ar.js library

The objective is to display 3D models of characters and enemies in AR using a phone or a webcam thus providing a experience similar to VTT but with the spiciness of IRL rpg session at a cheap cost. 

No need to buy expensive minifig, you just need a 3D model and to create a marker for it using [text](https://jeromeetienne.github.io/AR.js/three.js/examples/marker-training/examples/generator.html)
